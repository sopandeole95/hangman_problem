- All lives are lost (lose).

## Features

- Visual feedback for wrong guesses using ASCII art.
- Interactive and beginner-friendly.

## How to Play
1. Run the game using Python:
   ```bash
   python hangman_game.py

## Sample Gameplay
Welcome to Hangman!
Guess a letter: a
_ a _ _ a _
Guess a letter: b
You guessed 'b', that's not in the word and you lose a life.
